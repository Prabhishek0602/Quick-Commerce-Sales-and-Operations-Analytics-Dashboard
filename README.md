# Quick-Commerce-Sales-and-Operations-Analytics-Dashboard 

I created this project to analyze **Blinkit’s sales and operations data** using **Power BI**.  
My aim was simple: take raw sales data, clean it, transform it, and turn it into a dashboard that gives **clear, actionable insights** for decision-making.

## 🔨 What I Did  

1. **Explored the Dataset**  
   - The data had columns like Item Type, Fat Content, Outlet Establishment Year, and Location.  
   - I first familiarized myself with what each column meant and how it could add value.  

2. **Cleaned & Transformed the Data**  
   - Removed columns that weren’t relevant.  
   - Standardized category names (e.g., fat content values).  
   - Dealt with missing values to make the dataset reliable.  

3. **Created Key Metrics**  
   - Using DAX, I built measures for:  
     - Total Sales  
     - Average Sales  
     - Total Items Sold  
     - Average Rating  

4. **Designed the Dashboard**  
   - Laid out the visuals in a way that’s simple but powerful.  
   - Added slicers (Outlet Type, Location, Size, Item Type) so the user can interact and drill down.  

5. **Built the Visuals**  
   - Used bar charts, donut charts, tree maps, and line charts to highlight trends.  
   - Added KPI cards for at-a-glance numbers like total sales and items sold.
